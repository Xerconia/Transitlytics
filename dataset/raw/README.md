# Instructions for handling and understanding the raw data used in the project.

## Overview
The raw data used in this project consists of various datasets that capture household and individual characteristics, as well as trip information. This data is essential for building predictive models to determine trip purposes based on these characteristics.

## Data Structure
The raw data is organized into several files, each representing different aspects of the data:

- **Household Data**: Contains information about household characteristics such as income, size, and vehicle ownership.
- **Long Distance Travel Data**: Includes details about long-distance trips, including purpose, mode of transportation, distance, and duration.
- **Person Data**: Captures individual demographics such as age, gender, and employment status.
- **Trip Data**: Provides information on trip purposes and modes of transportation.
- **Vehicle Data**: Contains details about vehicle types and fuel efficiency.

## Data Handling Instructions
1. **Loading the Data**:
   - Use appropriate libraries (e.g., pandas) to load the datasets into dataframes.
   - Ensure that the file paths are correctly specified.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Perform initial exploration to understand the structure and contents of the datasets.
   - Check for missing values, duplicates, and data types.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values by either imputing or removing them based on the context.
   - Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
   - Convert data types as necessary for analysis.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features if required.
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Keep track of any changes made to the raw data for reproducibility.
   - Document any assumptions or decisions made during the data handling process.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that the raw data is not modified directly. Instead, create a separate processed dataset for analysis.
- Always back up the original raw data before performing any transformations.

By following these instructions, you will be able to effectively handle and understand the raw data used in this project, setting a solid foundation for further analysis and modeling.
